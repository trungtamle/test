Welcome to StackEdit!

Hey! I’m your first Markdown document in StackEdit1. Don’t delete me, I’m very helpful! I can be recovered anyway in the Utils tab of the  Settings dialog.

Documents

StackEdit stores your documents in your browser, which means all your documents are automatically saved locally and are accessible offline!

Note:

StackEdit is accessible offline after the application has been loaded for the first time.
Your local documents are not shared between different browsers or computers.
Clearing your browser’s data may delete all your local documents! Make sure your documents are synchronized with Google Drive or Dropbox (check out the  Synchronization section).
 Create a document

The document panel is accessible using the  button in the navigation bar. You can create a new document by clicking  New document in the document panel.

 Switch to another document

All your local documents are listed in the document panel. You can switch from one to another by clicking a document in the list or you can toggle documents using Ctrl+[ and Ctrl+].

 Rename a document

You can rename the current document by clicking the document title in the navigation bar.

 Delete a document

You can delete the current document by clicking  Delete document in the document panel.

 Export a document

You can save the current document to a file by clicking  Export to disk from the  menu panel.

Tip: Check out the  Publish a document section for a description of the different output formats.
Synchronization

StackEdit can be combined with  Google Drive and  Dropbox to have your documents saved in the Cloud. The synchronization mechanism takes care of uploading your modifications or downloading the latest version of your documents.

Note:

Full access to Google Drive or Dropbox is required to be able to import any document in StackEdit. Permission restrictions can be configured in the settings.
Imported documents are downloaded in your browser and are not transmitted to a server.
If you experience problems saving your documents on Google Drive, check and optionally disable browser extensions, such as Disconnect.
 Open a document

You can open a document from  Google Drive or the  Dropbox by opening the Synchronize sub-menu and by clicking Open from…. Once opened, any modification in your document will be automatically synchronized with the file in your Google Drive / Dropbox account.

 Save a document

You can save any document by opening the  Synchronize sub-menu and by clicking Save on…. Even if your document is already synchronized with Google Drive or Dropbox, you can export it to a another location. StackEdit can synchronize one document with multiple locations and accounts.

 Synchronize a document

Once your document is linked to a  Google Drive or a  Dropbox file, StackEdit will periodically (every 3 minutes) synchronize it by downloading/uploading any modification. A merge will be performed if necessary and conflicts will be detected.

If you just have modified your document and you want to force the synchronization, click the  button in the navigation bar.

Note: The  button is disabled when you have no document to synchronize.
 Manage document synchronization

Since one document can be synchronized with multiple locations, you can list and manage synchronized locations by clicking  Manage synchronization in the  Synchronize sub-menu. This will let you remove synchronization locations that are associated to your document.

Note: If you delete the file from Google Drive or from Dropbox, the document will no longer be synchronized with that location.
Publication

Once you are happy with your document, you can publish it on different websites directly from StackEdit. As for now, StackEdit can publish on Blogger, Dropbox, Gist, GitHub, Google Drive, Tumblr, WordPress and on any SSH server.

 Publish a document

You can publish your document by opening the  Publish sub-menu and by choosing a website. In the dialog box, you can choose the publication format:

Markdown, to publish the Markdown text on a website that can interpret it (GitHub for instance),
HTML, to publish the document converted into HTML (on a blog for example),
Template, to have a full control of the output.
Note: The default template is a simple webpage wrapping your document in HTML format. You can customize it in the Advanced tab of the  Settings dialog.
 Update a publication

After publishing, StackEdit will keep your document linked to that publication which makes it easy for you to update it. Once you have modified your document and you want to update your publication, click on the  button in the navigation bar.

Note: The  button is disabled when your document has not been published yet.
 Manage document publication

Since one document can be published on multiple locations, you can list and manage publish locations by clicking  Manage publication in the  menu panel. This will let you remove publication locations that are associated to your document.

Note: If the file has been removed from the website or the blog, the document will no longer be published on that location.
Markdown Extra

StackEdit supports Markdown Extra, which extends Markdown syntax with some nice features.

Tip: You can disable any Markdown Extra feature in the Extensions tab of the Settings dialog.

Note: You can find more information about Markdown syntax [here][2] and Markdown Extra extension here.
Tables

Markdown Extra has a special syntax for tables:

Item	Value
Computer	$1600
Phone	$12
Pipe	$1
You can specify column alignment with one or two colons:

Item	Value	Qty
Computer	$1600	5
Phone	$12	12
Pipe	$1	234
Definition Lists

Markdown Extra has a special syntax for definition lists too:

Term 1
Term 2
Definition A
Definition B
Term 3
Definition C

Definition D

part of definition D
Fenced code blocks

GitHub’s fenced code blocks are also supported with Highlight.js syntax highlighting:

// Foo
var bar = 0;
Tip: To use Prettify instead of Highlight.js, just configure the Markdown Extra extension in the  Settings dialog.

Note: You can find more information:

about Prettify syntax highlighting here,
about Highlight.js syntax highlighting here.
Footnotes

You can create footnotes like this2.

SmartyPants

SmartyPants converts ASCII punctuation characters into “smart” typographic punctuation HTML entities. For example:

ASCII	HTML
Single backticks	'Isn't this fun?'	‘Isn’t this fun?’
Quotes	"Isn't this fun?"	“Isn’t this fun?”
Dashes	-- is en-dash, --- is em-dash	– is en-dash, — is em-dash
Table of contents

You can insert a table of contents using the marker [TOC]:

MathJax

You can render LaTeX mathematical expressions using MathJax, as on http://math.stackexchange.com`/”>math.stackexchange.com:

The Gamma function satisfying Γ(n)=(n−1)!∀n∈N is via the Euler integral

Γ(z)=∫0∞tz−1e−tdt.
Tip: To make sure mathematical expressions are rendered properly on your website, include MathJax into your template:
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"></script>
Note: You can find more information about LaTeX mathematical expressions here.
UML diagrams

You can also render sequence diagrams like this:

Alice
Alice
Bob
Bob
Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob thinks
I am good thanks!
And flow charts like this:

Start
My Operation
Yes or No?
End
yes
no
Note: You can find more information:
